Memory address 31? (decimal) stores the current array address being working on AKA Array Element Address (start at address 31? in decimal, 1 behind the first element of the array--depends on how long this program is)
R1 stores the for loop counter (starts at 20 in decimal and decreases)
R2 stores the number 10 (decimal)/the closest array value to the number to try to match so far
R0 stores the number to be added to the array so far (starts at 0)
Memory address 30? (decimal) stores the number to try to match AKA Num To Match Address (defaults at 0)
Memory address 29? (decimal) stores the minimum difference between the number to try to match and the closest array value AKA Min Diff Address

Add 1 to Array Element Address by loading the Array Element Address contents into R3; ARRAY INPUT FOR LOOP START
Then adding 1 (Immed) to R3
Then storing the R3 contents back into the Array Element Address
Read in the character into R3; READ NEXT CHAR OF NUM
Subtract the Enter key ASCII code (Immed=?) from R3
If R3 contents = 0 character is Enter, jump to ALL DIGITS OF NUM ENTERED BRANCH
Add Enter key ASCII code (Immed=?) back to R3
Multiply R0 contents by 10 (decimal, stored in R2) to move it to the tens place
Add the R3 contents into R0
Unconditional jump to READ NEXT CHAR OF NUM
Else, unconditional jump to ARRAY INPUT FOR LOOP END
Store number from R0 into memory by indirect addressing the Array Element Address (31?); ALL DIGITS OF NUM ENTERED BRANCH
Set R0 contents back to 0
Subtract 1 from R1 and if > 0, branch back to ARRAY INPUT FOR LOOP START
Set R1 back to 20 (decimal) to prep for next loop; ARRAY INPUT FOR LOOP END
Set R0 back to 0
Set Array Element Address back to 1 behind the first element of the array (31? in decimal)
Set R2 to the value of the first element of the array (indirect addressed by location 32? in decimal)
Output M
Output A
Output T
Output C
Output H
Output space
Output T
Output O
Output ':'
Read in the character of the number to try to match into R3; MATCH INPUT START
Subtract the Enter key ASCII code (Immed=? in ASCII, ? in binary) from R3
If R3 contents = 0 character is Enter, jump to MATCH INPUT END
Add Enter key ASCII code (Immed=? in ASCII, ? in binary) back to R3
Multiply R0 contents by 10 (decimal, stored in R2) to move it to the tens place
Add the R3 contents into R0
Unconditional jump back to MATCH INPUT START
Store R0 contents into the Num to Match Address; MATCH INPUT END
Add 1 to Array Element Address by loading the Array Element Address contents into R3; CLOSEST MATCH FOR LOOP START
Then adding 1 (Immed) to R3
Then storing the R3 contents back into the Array Element Address
Load R3 with the value from the Num To Match Address
Subtract the value indirect addressed by the Array Element Address from R3
If R3 contents >= 0, jump to COMPARE DIFFS
Else, Negate R3 contents by flipping the bits (NOT instruction)
Then adding 1 (Immed) to R3
Subtract the value of the Min Diff Address from R3; COMPARE DIFFS
If R3 >= 0, jump to NEXT ELEMENT
Else, found the new closest match so add the value of the Min Diff Address back to R3
Store R3 contents to the Min Diff Address
Load the value indirect addressed by the Array Element Address into R2
Subtract 1 from R1 and if > 0, branch to CLOSEST MATCH FOR LOOP START; NEXT ELEMENT
Output N
Output U
Output M
Output ':'
Load the value of the Num To Match Address into R0
Print the num to match (stored in R0)...
Output C
Output L
Output O
Output S
Output E
Output S
Output T
Output ':'
Print the closest match (stored in R2)...
