Memory address 31? (decimal) stores the current array address being working on AKA Array Element Address (start at address 31? in decimal, 1 behind the first element of the array--depends on how long this program is)
R1 stores the for loop counter (starts at 20 in decimal and decreases)
R2 stores the closest array value to the number to try to match so far?
R0 stores the number to be added to the array so far (starts at 0)/the number to try to match
Add 1 to Array Element Address by setting R3 to 1; ARRAY INPUT FOR LOOP START
Then adding the Array Element Address to R3
Then storing the R3 contents back into the Array Element Address
Read in the character into R3
Subtract the Enter key ASCII code (Immed=?) from R3
If R3 contents = 0 character is Enter, jump to ALL DIGITS OF NUM ENTERED BRANCH
Add Enter key ASCII code (Immed=?) back to R3
Multiply R0 contents by 10 (decimal) to move it to the tens place
Add the R3 contents into R0
Subtract 1 from R1 and if > 0, branch back to ARRAY INPUT FOR LOOP START
Else, unconditional jump to ARRAY INPUT FOR LOOP END
Store number from R0 into memory by indirect addressing the Array Element Address (31?); ALL DIGITS OF NUM ENTERED BRANCH
Set R0 contents back to 0
Unconditional jump back to ARRAY INPUT FOR LOOP START to read in next character of the number
Set R1 back to 20 (decimal) to prep for next loop; ARRAY INPUT FOR LOOP END
Set R0 back to 0
Set Array Element Address back to 1 behind the first element of the array
Read in the character of the number to try to match into R3; MATCH INPUT START
Subtract the Enter key ASCII code (Immed=?) from R3
If R3 contents = 0 character is Enter, jump to CLOSEST MATCH FOR LOOP START
Add Enter key ASCII code (Immed=?) back to R3
Multiply R0 contents by 10 (decimal) to move it to the tens place
Add the R3 contents into R0
Unconditional jump back to MATCH INPUT START
Add 1 to Array Element Address by setting R3 to 1; CLOSEST MATCH FOR LOOP START
Then adding the Array Element Address to R3
Then storing the R3 contents back into the Array Element Address
